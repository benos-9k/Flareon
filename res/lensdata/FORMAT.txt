Empty lines and lines beginning with # are ignored.

Lens data consists of a single line per optical surface. For example, a system
with a single lens will have 2 lines. A system with two lenses touching would
have 3 lines (front,back and touching surface).

The order of the lines is from the front (where the light enters) of the lens
system to the back (closest to the film,sensor).

Each line consists of four values:
  1) radius: The radius of curvature (all surfaces are assumed to be spherical).
     The value is positive if, when looking from the front, the surface is
     convex (curves away from the viewer). The value is negative if the surface
     is concave (curves toward the viewer).
     If the value is zero, the surface is assumed to be an (flat) aperture stop.
  2) axpos: The distance between the current surface and the next.
  3) N: the index of refraction. A value of 1.0 is assumed to be air.
  4) aperture: the aperture of the surface (note, this can be different for
     the two sides of a lens)

Rays which miss any lens surface (or hit the aperture stop) are assumed to be
blocked.
